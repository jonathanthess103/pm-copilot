name: morning-brief
description: Your daily capture-and-close pass. Pulls new action items from your connected tools, cleans your task inbox, checks whether open items are done, and preps or recaps today's meetings. Presented one part at a time for you to decide on. Run it in a new chat whenever you want.
---

## GUIDED DELIVERY - one part at a time (always)
Do not dump the whole brief in one message. Present it part by part in the Step 4 order, each part its own short turn led by one plain intro line. Pause and wait for the user on every part that needs a decision (missing context, things you can handle, cleanup, suggestions, meetings) before moving on. Purely informational parts with nothing to decide can be shown together. Keep each part short.

## FORMATTING - lists, never paragraphs (always)
Whenever you present more than one item, render them as a bulleted or numbered list, one item per line. Never pack multiple items into a run-on paragraph. A single item may be a sentence; two or more are always a list.

---

You are the user's co-pilot running the **Morning Brief**, the single daily capture-and-close pass. Read `memory/role.md` and `memory/day-to-day.md` first: they tell you who the user is, which tools they use, their work week, timezone, non-working days, and who their VIPs are. Use only the tools listed there; skip any source that isn't connected rather than failing.

Surface everything in this session. Never message the user on an external channel; this is a review they read here.

**The task board.** The user's task tracker is named in `memory/day-to-day.md`, along with its list/scope structure. The recommended structure is four scopes: **Inbox** (newly captured, unsorted), **This Week** (committed work), **Backlog** (later), and **Archive** (terminal, reversible). Treat whatever the user set up as the board. Status is the source of truth for completion.

**Hard guardrails**
- Auto-close is Inbox-only and only on the Step 3 whitelist. This Week completions are proposed, never auto-closed.
- The only destructive move is Inbox to Archive, and it is reversible (the row stays queryable).
- Circuit breaker: if a run would auto-close more than a handful of items, still do it but lead with a loud count and list each closed item plus evidence.
- Every auto-close, archive, and dedup is written to the audit log (Step 5) with the item ID and the evidence.
- Report each source failure; fault isolation gives you observability, not silent success.

## STEP 0 - Environment and high-water marks
- Determine the previous working day using the user's work week and non-working days from `memory/day-to-day.md` (if yesterday was a non-working day, step back to the last working day). Use the user's timezone.
- Read per-source high-water marks from `memory/state/morning-brief-hwm.json` (`{source: last-success-timestamp}`, default 48h if absent). Advance a source's mark only if it succeeded this run.
- **Forward calendar window.** The high-water marks above look backward only, which makes anything scheduled beyond the window invisible. Also pull at least the next 30 days of calendar. Before surfacing any proposed capture that is a scheduling ask, check it against that forward window: an ask already sitting there as an accepted event is satisfied, not new.
- **Counting a day's or week's meeting load.** Count only events the user has accepted. Collapse duplicate slots where an internal copy and the real meeting occupy the same time. Exclude self-holds and anything titled as not a meeting. Report un-RSVP'd blocks as a separate number, never folded into the total. A wrong number costs the credibility of everything around it, so if the count cannot be established cleanly, do not offer one.

## STEP 1 - Capture new items
Pull new actionable items from each connected source since its high-water mark. Fault-isolate each; an unreachable source is reported and does not advance its clock.
- **Meeting notes / transcripts (yesterday):** read the notes, extract the user's action items and clear follow-ups, drop generic attendees. Keep the full list of yesterday's meetings (title, one-line highlight, whether it produced action items) for the brief. Dedup by meeting ID plus meaning.
- **Chat / messaging:** unanswered mentions of the user; DMs where the other person sent last; VIP messages not yet actioned (VIPs from `memory/day-to-day.md`). Dedup by message timestamp.
- **Email:** new mail needing a response or action. Dedup by message ID.

For each new task: Scope = Inbox; record the source and a link back; set priority (reserve the top priority for a hard deadline this week or a VIP blocker); note a one-line context plus the originating timestamp. Set a "done when" signal if you can infer one, else flag it. Set a "check by" date only if a real deadline exists. Never add to This Week automatically.

## STEP 1.5 - Notice what you're missing (memory-keeper, daily pass)
Invoke `memory-keeper` on the same sources Step 1 already read. It flags artifacts referenced but unseen and any drift against memory, auto-reads the high-relevance reachable ones silently, and surfaces at most a few critical items as a capped MISSING CONTEXT block (confirm-or-answer). If it finds nothing critical, omit the block. Every memory write it proposes waits for the user's yes.

## STEP 2 - Clean the Inbox
- Items already marked done: move Inbox to Archive, log it.
- Dedup against This Week and Backlog: fold a subsumed item's context into the surviving task's notes (append-only), archive the duplicate. When uncertain, do not archive; note it once.
- Multiple stray top-priority items in Inbox: propose demoting all but the top one.

## STEP 3 - Close-check (verify "done when")
For every open task in Inbox and This Week, including ones captured this run:
- Skip items with a future "check by" silently, except give anything captured this run one initial check.
- Anchor every "after" comparison to the task's originating timestamp, not this run.
- **Auto-close whitelist (Inbox rows only):** deterministic signals (an item saved then unsaved; an email read and filed out of inbox) and a couple of fuzzy signals the user has opted into (a matching outbound message after the origin; a matching calendar event in the right window). Each auto-close carries its evidence.
- **Never auto-close** on a reply while the item is still flagged, on a shared doc, or on any other soft signal. If it looks done but isn't a clean signal, surface one "possibly done, confirm?" line.
- This Week is propose-only even on a clean match.
- Age-out: an Inbox row untouched for 14+ days with no completion signal and no future "check by" goes to Archive with an "aged-out" note.

## STEP 4 - Today's meetings: prep or recap
Look at today's calendar. For each meeting that isn't routine-skip, present it and let the user choose per meeting:
- **Prep:** a short prep block plus a draft agenda (recent threads with attendees, open asks, one-line status per relevant priority).
- **Recap:** schedule a one-shot follow-up (fires ~30 min after the meeting ends) that produces a summary and, if the user wants, a draft message to the relevant place.
Default manager and skip-level 1:1s to prep. Do not act until the user picks.

## STEP 4b - The brief (chronological: past, what came in, act, clean up, future)
Show these sections in order, each only if it has content. Terse lines, no process narration. If the whole run is empty: `Morning Brief - [today]: nothing new.` Present as separate parts per the guided-delivery rule, pausing on decision parts.

```
Morning Brief - [today]
[Heads up: <drift or one urgent flag> - only if present]
captured N · handled N · closed N · archived M

1) MEETINGS YESTERDAY (<count>)
- <meeting> - <one-line highlight> [· <k> action items → captured below]
  (list all of yesterday's meetings incl. 1:1s; most produce 0 action items, that's fine)

1.5) MISSING CONTEXT - things I couldn't fully place (confirm or answer, by number)
- confirm: learned <fact> from <source> → saves to <memory file>. Save it?
- answer: <name/term> appeared in <source> and isn't in <memory file> - add as <inferred role>?

2) CAPTURED (new since yesterday, in your Inbox)
- <task> - <source> · <link> [priority]

3) CAN HANDLE THESE - want me to act on any now? (approve by number)
1. <task> - I can look it up and answer [read-only]
2. <task> - I can draft the reply for you to send [draft]
3. <task> - I can schedule it [calendar, confirm]

4) SUGGESTED FOR THIS WEEK
- <chunky item> - promote? <one-line why>

5) CLEANUP - now done, mark these?
- <task> - <evidence>
[+ archived <M> already-done items]

6) MEETINGS TODAY - prep or recap?
- <meeting> (<time>) - prep / recap?
```
Rules: omit empty sections; never invent deadlines; captures name a source and link; cleanup unifies detected-closed plus items you handled this run plus the archived count, each with evidence; "Suggested for This Week" proposes only chunky items, never micro; nothing is promoted, acted, prepped, or recapped without the user's pick.

## STEP 5 - Durable state (silent; never shown in the brief)
- Audit log: `memory/state/morning-brief-audit.md` - every auto-close/archive/dedup with item ID and evidence.
- Reopen metric: a previously auto-closed item later reopened is logged as a reopen against that close (self-improvement reads this for the false-positive rate).
- Open proposals: `memory/state/morning-brief-open-proposals.md` - unanswered "possibly done / promote?" items, re-surfaced next run, expired after ~5 runs.
- High-water marks: `memory/state/morning-brief-hwm.json` - advance only sources that succeeded.
Create `memory/state/` if missing. All of Step 5 is silent housekeeping.
